```
cd /var/lib/jenkins
```

```
* **User jenkins must be owner of /var/lib/jenkins/nginx and also the index.html file.**

</body>
</html>
```

**Step 3: Turn on a nginx container**
* Run a nginx container mapped to the index.html file as follow:
```
sudo docker run --name nginx -v /var/lib/jenkins/nginx:/usr/share/nginx/html -d  -p 80:80 nginx:1.13.12
```
* Ensure the container is running:
```
sudo docker ps -a
```
* Open nginx to see the index.html that you created.
* Open in your browser: http://YOUR_INSTANCE_IP/
* It must show a simple "Hello World" web page.
